# Releases

## 0.1b1

## &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Changed the way it works almost entirely by converting .mp4 file to .mp3 directly (using moviepy lib).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Changed the resolution of .mp4 files from 144p to 360p.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;Known issues:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We are investigating a connection timeout when downloading large playlist, but the issue is inconsistent.
